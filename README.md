# QR-Code
You've built a web application that enables users to input data they want to encode into QR codes. This application utilizes HTML for the user interface, CSS for styling, and JavaScript for interactivity.
With the integration of an API, you can dynamically generate QR codes based on user input. Users can enter their desired information, and upon a trigger action, such as clicking a button,
the application sends this data to the QR code generation API. 
In response, the API provides the corresponding QR code image, which is then displayed on the web page for users to access and use.

Your application simplifies the process of creating QR codes, making it convenient and user-friendly for a variety of purpose
